<H3> War in Libya 2010 - 2011 </H3>
<P>
Khadafi won't leave his post and stays in command over Libya. The major city's are captured by the rebels but Khadafi fight back with his army.<BR/>
Tanks are Khadafi major power and he gain fast control over some city's but then for the first time in history an allied force of Amerika , Europe and Islamic country's are comming to help the Rebel army to overtrown Khadafi. Khadafi starts this game with a lot of tanks + invention Rockets representing the terror of destruction <BR/>
The rebels starts this game with some carriers and fighters + bombers representing the allied forces <BR/>+ invention Warbonds , representing the aid from Europe (Italy,France,Belgium) 
<BR/>+increased factory production representing the aid from Islamic country's like oman,Egypt,Tunesia,... .
